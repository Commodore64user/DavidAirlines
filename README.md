### Why are we doing this? (and other qs)

The main objective of this project is to utilise all the concepts and technologies learnt during the Software Development Digital Bootcamp. Some of the tools utilised in the project include (but are not limited to) Java, Spring, JUnit, MySQL, Postman, GitHub. 

We were expected to write a full CRUD application (including testing) in the span of five days, I expected this to be a difficult yet achievable task as it was my first time creating a whole app from the ground app, or the back end at least.

My exceptions coming in were not to high as I thought I would soon hit walls from which it would take me a long time to get out of, and given the limited time to complete the task I originally focused mainly on completing the bare essentials, but as I went along found I could reel out a bit and ended up adding a couple small classes to the project.

I was happy to have achieved a reservation system where flyers can choose from an existing pool of flights (this happens randomly) and a random string is generated as a reservation number, much like a real life airline booking. I had also other ideas like limiting the number of seats per flights and overbooking (max profits) where passengers are denied boarding (`` ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ``) if flight is overbooked.

One particular challenge I found was testing my create method for the passenger entity. The string "reservation" is randomly generated upon each passenger booking a flight, as the string is random and different each time it is [hard] to run the integration test as whatever string you give will not match the random generated by the test.

# Risk Assessment:

## Case 1: 

### Description
Project is not completed on time.  
### Evaluation:
I would fail to have a completed project to show prospective clients.
### Likelihood: 
Low
### Response: 
even though project would not be marked, continue working and upload at the earliest possible time beyond deadline.
### Impact Level: 
medium
### control measures:
work every day first focusing on the chasis of the application and the adding extra stuff.
### Responsibility:
I am responsible for mitigating the risk


## Case 2:  

### Description
I am unable to create the application and to link it to the database.
### Evaluation:
The application would be broken and thus not work.
### Likelihood: 
medium
### Response: 
rewatch recordings and follow along in order to complete the task
### Impact Level: 
high
### control measures:
rewatch video leassons and focus on understanding the concepts and the try again.
### Responsibility:
I am responsible for mitigating the risk
